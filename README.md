# Coursework Portfolio

This repository contains programs and projects I developed as part of my college coursework in computer science. It serves as a public record of my learning progress, problem-solving approach, and hands-on experience with programming concepts.

## About

Each project in this repository was created for an academic assignment, lab, or course project. The focus is on functionality, clarity, and applying core computer science principles rather than polish or production readiness.

## Contents

- Small programs and utilities
- Course assignments and labs
- Experiments and practice implementations

Projects are organized into folders by taken classes.

## Purpose

- Document academic progress
- Showcase practical programming experience
- Provide reference material for future work

## Notes

The projects done in this portfolio do not reflect the extent of my abilities in programming, only what i was tasked to do by the college courses.
